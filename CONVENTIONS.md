# RWA Conventions

## Folder and File Naming Conventions

### Folder Naming Convention

- All folders within the clients follow the kebab-case naming convention. This means folder names are lowercase with words separated by hyphens ("-").
- All folders within the programs follow the snake*case naming convention. This means folder names are lowercase with words separated by underscores ("*").

### Component File Naming Convention

- Component files within the project follow the TitleCase naming convention. This means that the first letter of each word in the filename is capitalized, and there are no spaces or special characters. For example: `MyComponent.jsx`

### Helper File Naming Convention

- Helper files within the project follow the lowercase naming convention. This includes files such as index files, types files, and utility files. For example: `index.ts`, `types.ts`, `utils.ts`

## Folder Structure

- **clients/**
  - Contains all RWA typescript sdk code.
- **programs/**
  - Contains all programs deployed on the solana blockchain.

## Usage
