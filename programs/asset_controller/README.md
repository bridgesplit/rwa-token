# Asset Controller Program
## Instructions
1. create - Equivalent of create mint
2. delegate - Delegates the mint
3. transfer - Permissioned transfer leveraging policy accounts
4. account/create - Creates token account
5. account/close - Closes token account
6. enforce/execute - Transfer hook invoked post transfer to verify token went through
7. token/issue - Equivalent of mint more tokens
8. token/void - Burn tokens

## Transaction Approvals
Transactions are done via a call to the transfer instruction. This instruction requires a valid transfer approval account which is generated by running the proposed transaction across all existing policy registrys. If all policy registrys apply to Valid or are not applicable to the transaction, the transaction proceeds as planned.
